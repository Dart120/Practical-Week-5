            Computer simulation can be useful in many circumstances, allowing us to observe scientific phenomena which are too dangerous for us to carry out in practise and save resources building models which we can observe in a virtual world.
            One such example is crash testing vehicles, in which modern manufacturers can make many virtual prototypes and test them thoroughly to see which models would actually stand up to real crash testing.
