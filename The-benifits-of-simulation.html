            Computer simulation can be useful in many circumstances, allowing us to observe scientific phenomena which are too dangerous for us to carry out in practise and save resources building models which we can observe in a virtual world.
            One such example is crash testing vehicles, in which modern manufacturers can make many virtual prototypes and test them thoroughly to see which models would actually stand up to real crash testing. This has many advantages, such as:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h>
                    Costing less resources
                </h>
                <p>
                    Destroying a thousand virtual prototypes uses less steel and manufacturing time than creating even a single real prototype. As computers get faster and faster, testing virtual models becomes substantially cheaper and more accessible so this
                    can only grow as the technologies are improved.

            </li>

            <li>
                <h>
                    Easy to adjust tests
                </h>
                <p>
                    Changing a few settings is easier than building a new testing facility. For large companies, this saves time, effort, space and money since a few computers are much cheaper to operate, maintain and setup than a working testing facility. For
                    smaller companies, simulation will often be the only option, since they don't have the money to build a facility or even enough prototypes to thoroughly test their product.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

            Of course, these aren't the only places simulations are useful. AI can easily be trained by testing a series of inputs on a computer simulation instead of having to collect and organize a large set of training data for it to work on. Accurate physics
            simulations are useful in all sorts of areas, ranging from actual scientific research to more and more realistic rendering software and game engines. Training simulations, such as in F1 and Pilot training, can save millions since crashes don't
            destroy the real, expensive equipment and also complete beginners can try something they haven't done before with little risk, which is simply impossible in real conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, computer simulation has come a long way so far and will only grow further. Its many uses and advantages in our modern society mean it will continue to thrive and may even become an integral part of our lives.
