            Here are five examples of computers making positive contributions to society
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h>
                    Improving communication
                </h>
                <p>
                    Computer science has offered to us are the ability to send an email from our phones, being able to see our friends and families at great distances with minimum delay, and celebrities and philanthropists making their
                    thoughts known to followers with a Facebook post or a 140-character tweet. Without these tools we would find it more difficult to connect to each other by using phone and mail correspondence and information would propagate more slowly.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h>
                    Immediate access to information
                </h>
                <p>
                    Computers have made it possible to have almost instantaneous access to information that is constantly being updated. This benefits education but it also has a positive impact on everyday life- just think how many of your
                    questions have been answered by Google today.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h>
                    Developing education
                </h>
                <p>
                    These days it is hard to imagine education without computer software and the Internet. Common education applications can be seen in every student's life: taking classes online, looking for library items on electronic
                    catalogues, researching for papers, and sharing work with your team on the cloud. Language learning is one of the education fields that have benefited greatly from computer science, from finding free online resources to speaking with a native
                    on Skype or Messenger to improve your language skills.

            </li>

            <li>
                <h>
                    Improving solutions
                </h>
                <p>
                    Computer science allows our society to follow its tendency of doing things faster and better. Many things that have a positive impact on our lives did not even exist five or ten years ago, and this is particularly
                    obvious in the service industry. Services like Airbnb and Uber have been made possible through computer software and once you try these, itâ€™s difficult to imagine transportation and accommodation without them.

            </li>

            <li>
                <h>
                    Increased productivity and business growth
                </h>
                <p>
                    Computers have been shown to increase output per hour and have transformed the workplace more than any other innovation. This change, called the Information Revolution, has obliged companies to rethink their management procedures and
                    organizational structures, but has also enabled them to become more productive, more profitable, and to expand their operations in new places. Employees are also benefiting from this change as they are being better paid, and companies now
                    recruit better-educated workers in order to face current demands for labor. The growth was so fast that official statistics failed to reflect it properly, but everyone in the business field with some past experience will be able to see the
                    difference between the times before the Information Revolution and what we are experiencing today.

        </ul>

            The entire pallet of computer science advantages is hard to grasp, but one thing is for sure: computers have made everything faster and more accessible. Just like any other tool, computers can be used for doing good or for causing harm, and the choice is
            entirely ours.
