            Artificial Intelligence is revolutionary and is being applied more and more in recent times to solve problems now that we have the technology to facilitate it. There are many forms of AI such as machine learning and neural networks, but they all rely on some form of knowledge base and learning through repetition and examples. We can train AI to think like humans using modern data analysis techniques. Using AI for medical purposes is a new frontier in AI and is very good as it reduces costs and increases efficiency and diagnostic times.

        <b><p>1. Diagnosing Diseases</p></b>
        
        <ul>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">
                Correctly diagnosing diseases takes years of medical training. Even then, diagnostics is often an arduous, time-consuming process. In many fields, the demand for experts far exceeds the available supply. This puts doctors under strain and often delays life-saving patient diagnostics.

                Machine Learning – particularly Deep Learning algorithms – have recently made huge advances in automatically diagnosing diseases, making diagnostics cheaper and more accessible.
                <br></br>
                <b>How Machines Learn To Diagnose-</b>
                <br></br>
                Machine Learning algorithms can learn to see patterns similarly to the way doctors see them. A key difference is that algorithms need a lot of concrete examples – many thousands – in order to learn. And these examples need to be neatly digitized – machines can’t read between the lines in textbooks.
                <br></br>
                So Machine Learning is particularly helpful in areas where the diagnostic information a doctor examines is already digitized.

        <b><p>2. Personalising Treatment</p></b>
        <ul>
            <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;">
                Different patients respond to drugs and treatment schedules differently. So personalized treatment has enormous potential to increase patients’ lifespans. But it’s very hard to identify which factors should affect the choice of treatment.
                <br></br>
                Machine Learning can automate this complicated statistical work – and help discover which characteristics indicate that a patient will have a particular response to a particular treatment. So the algorithm can predict a patient’s probable response to a particular treatment.
                <br></br>
                The system learns this by cross-referencing similar patients and comparing their treatments and outcomes. The resulting outcome predictions make it much easier for doctors to design the right treatment plan.
