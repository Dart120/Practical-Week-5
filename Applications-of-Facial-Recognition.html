            Facial recognition is an evolving technology that can be used to improve various parts of our everyday lives.

                    Prevent Retail Crime
                </h>
                <p>
                    Face recognition is currently being used to instantly identify when known shoplifters, organized retail criminals or people with a history of fraud enter retail establishments.

                    Unlock Phones
                </h>
                <p>
                    A variety of phones including the latest iPhone are now using face recognition to unlock phones. This technology is a powerful way to protect personal data and ensure that, if a phone is stolen, sensitive data remains inaccessible by
                    the perpetrator.

                    Find Missing People
                </h>
                <p>
                    Face recognition can be used to find missing children and victims of human trafficking. As long as missing individuals are added to a database, law enforcement can become alerted as soon as they are recognized by face recognitionâ€”be it an airport,
                    retail store or other public space. In fact, 3000 missing children were discovered in just four days using face recognition in India!

                    Diagnose Diseases
                </h>
                <p>
                    Face recognition can be used to diagnose diseases that cause detectable changes in appearance. As an example, the National Human Genome Institute Research Institute, uses face recognition to detect a rare disease called DiGeorge syndrome,
                    in which there is a portion of the 22nd chromosome missing. Face recognition has helped diagnose the disease in 96% of cases.
