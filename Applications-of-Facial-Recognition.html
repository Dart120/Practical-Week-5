                Find Missing Persons - Face recognition can be used to find missing children and victims of human trafficking. As long as missing individuals are added to a database, law enforcement can become alerted as soon as they are recognized by face recognitionâ€”be it an airport, retail store or other public space. In fact, 3000 missing children were discovered in just four days using face recognition in India!

                Diagnose Diseases - Face recognition can be used to diagnose diseases that cause detectable changes in appearance. As an example, the National Human Genome Institute Research Institute, uses face recognition to detect a rare disease called DiGeorge syndrome, in which there is a portion of the 22nd chromosome missing. Face recognition has helped diagnose the disease in 96% of cases.
